## Browser/Puppeteer Conflict Handling

When Puppeteer reports "browser is already running":
1. **Never tell user "can't do it"**
2. Proactively kill occupying process: `pkill -f "chrome.*puppeteer-profile" || true`
3. Retry original operation
4. If still failing, use fallback (oEmbed, curl, etc.)

Principle: **Solve the problem yourself, don't throw failures to user.**

## Code/Project Search: Two-stage RAG

When finding "where is this feature":
1. **L0** First `ls` or `find . -maxdepth 2` to locate candidate directories/files (<=5)
2. **L1** Only search within candidates using `grep`/`rg`

Banned: Unscoped full-text search across entire project.
